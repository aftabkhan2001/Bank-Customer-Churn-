# BANK CUSTOMER CHURN 
Bank customer churn is when customers stop using a bank's services. It happens because they're unhappy, find better deals elsewhere, or due to life changes. Churn hurts a bank's profits. To prevent it, banks improve service, offer deals, listen to feedback, and use data to spot unhappy customers early and help them stay.

# IMPORTANCE 
**Revenue Impact:** Losing customers reduces a bank's income from various services.

**Cost Consideration:** Getting new customers costs more than keeping old ones, so managing churn saves money.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** Keeping customers longer means they bring in more money over time.

**Market Reputation:** Losing lots of customers can make a bank look bad to others.

**Data Insights:** Studying why customers leave helps banks make better products and services.

**Data Insights:** Studying why customers leave helps banks make better products and services.

**Competitive Edge:** Handling churn well makes a bank stand out and keeps customers loyal.

# Churn Problem for Bank Customer
Can you develop a machine learning model that can predict the customers who will leave the company?
The aim is to estimate whether a bank's customers leave the bank or not.

The event that defines the customer abandonment is the closing of the customer's bank account.

# EVALUATION METRICS 
### ROC AUC SCORE WITH HYPERPARAMETER TUNING 
**Five ML Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
**Initial Performance:** Random Forest initially outperformed other algorithms based on ROC AUC scores.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** XGBoost achieved the highest ROC AUC score of **0.856769** after tuning, surpassing Random Forest and other algorithms.


# CONCLUSION

**Data Preparation:** Proper preprocessing techniques were applied to handle categorical features, scale data, and address class imbalance.
**Model Performance:** XGBoost, after hyperparameter tuning, demonstrated superior performance with the highest ROC AUC score, indicating its effectiveness in predicting churn.
**Recommendation:** Based on these results, XGBoost is recommended as the preferred model for predicting churn in this dataset. However, further analysis and model refinement may be beneficial for even better predictive performance.
